  <h2>Ranked List of My Hobbies</h2>

  <div class="hobby-item">
    <h3>Gaming</h3>
    <img src="gaming.jpg" alt="Gaming" class="hobby-img">
    <p>
      In the world of pixels and chaos, I find my battlefield. Like Guts wielding the Dragon Slayer, I wield my controller — not to escape, but to conquer. Every boss fight is a reflection of inner struggle, and every respawn is a reminder that I refuse to stay down.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="hobby-item">
    <h3>Jogging</h3>
    <img src="jogging.jpg" alt="Jogging" class="hobby-img">
    <p>
      When the weight of the world gets too heavy, I run. Not from my demons, but with them. Each step, like Guts trudging through mud and blood, is a declaration — I will keep moving forward, no matter the pain.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="hobby-item">
    <h3>Basketball</h3>
    <img src="basketball.jpg" alt="Basketball" class="hobby-img">
    <p>
      Basketball isn't just a game. It's a war zone. Strategy, pressure, grit — every match reminds me of Guts in the heat of battle. You push, you fight, you rise, or you fall. But either way, you leave it all on the court.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="hobby-item">
    <h3>Eating</h3>
    <img src="eating.jpg" alt="Eating" class="hobby-img">
    <p>
      Even the Struggler must feed. Eating isn’t indulgence — it’s survival. A moment of calm in a world that never stops tearing. Like Guts resting between wars, I eat to regain strength… to fight again.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="hobby-item">
    <h3>Sleeping</h3>
    <img src="sleeping.jpg" alt="Sleeping" class="hobby-img">
    <p>
      Sleep — the only time I don’t have to struggle. But even in dreams, the Brand burns. Like Guts haunted by demons in his rest, I find no true peace. Still, I close my eyes, because tomorrow, I fight again.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>GOD DOESN'T PLAY DICE</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>"Chaos whispers secrets only the brave dare hear."</li>
      <li>"Strength is forged in pain and shadow."</li>
      <li>"In darkness, I find my true self."</li>
      <li>"Every scar is a story carved in blood."</li>
